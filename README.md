## Introduction

This repository is a toy RDBMS for NJU "Introduction to Databases" course. It is implemented in C++ and supports a
subset of SQL queries.
Six Labs are included in this repository, and the details of each lab are as follows:

* Lab 1: Storage, implement the disk manager and the buffer manager.
* Lab 2: Executor, Implement `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` queries and basic operators like filter, sort, etc.
* Lab 3. Executor, Implement `JOIN` and `AGGREGATE` queries.
* Lab 4 : Index, implement the index handle and B+ tree index.
* Lab 5 (future): Concurrency, implement SS2PL concurrency control and deadlock detection.
* Lab 6 (future): Recovery, implement log manager and recovery manager to support WAL/ARIES recovery algorithm.

The project is mostly inspired by [Rucbase](https://github.com/ruc-deke/rucbase-lab)
, and some components follow the design of
 [BusTub](https://github.com/cmu-db/bustub),  [MiniOB](https://github.com/oceanbase/miniob). Thanks for their great work!

## System requirements

We tested WSDB on MacOS and Ubuntu, but if it also works on other systems, please let us know by issuing
or pulling requests.

## How to build

First clone the repository from github.

```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/nju-websoft/NJU_DBPractice
```

Install requirments using package manager.

For Ubuntu or Debian:

```shell
$ sudo apt install gcc g++ cmake flex bison libreadline-dev
```

For MacOS:

```shell
$ sudo brew install clang cmake flex bison readline
```

NOTE: Flex and Bison versions will be checked in `src/parser/CMakeLists.txt`, you can modify the minimum version to fit your environment and check if it compiles.

We recommend flex >= 2.6 and bison >=3.8. If your package manager does not provide the latest version and your version fails to compile `wsdb`, please install them manually. you can check the version by running `flex --version` and `bison --version`.

Low versions of the compiler and cmake may also cause problems, such as missing libraries, error finding include headers, etc. So please make sure you have the latest version of them.

Then change directory into the repository foot and run

```shell
$ mkdir build && cd build
```

```shell
$ cmake .. && make -j8
```

About how to change cmake configurations, please refer to their guide.

## Tutorial

The Chinese version of the lab tutorial can be found under `docs`, please read them carefully before coding if you are
studying NJU DB course.
